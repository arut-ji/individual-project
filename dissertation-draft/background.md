# Background

## Code Smells
According to Martin Fowler and Kent Beck [Ref], code smells are the characteristics which can be used to indicate
flaws that could possibly be problematic. However, the code smell itself does not always lead to a program failure,
but it can be used to suggest improvements to the code in order to prevent errors.
