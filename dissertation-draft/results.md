This chapter presents the result produced from running the implemented smells detectors.
There are 6 smells detectors successfully implemented, which are associated with the following smells:

- Incomplete Tasks (ICT)
- Long Statements (LS)
- Avoid Comments (AC)
- Improper Alignment (IA)
- Duplicated Liveness and Readiness Probes (DLARP)
- Missing Readiness Probe (MRP)

The smell which occurs the most is Avoid Comments (IA) with 18,530 instance found, as shown in table 6.1. 
The first runner-up is Long Statements (LS).
